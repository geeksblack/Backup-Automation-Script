Project: Backup Automation Script

Objective:
This project demonstrates a simple way to automate file backups using a Bash script. The script copies files from a source directory to a backup directory and logs all operations with timestamps.
Features:

    Automatically creates the backup directory if it doesnâ€™t exist.
    Copies files from the source directory (SRC) to the backup directory (BACKUP).
    Logs backup operations, including timestamps, in the backup.log file.

Files:

    backup.sh: The main Bash script for performing the backup.
    backup.log: A log file that records details of each backup operation.

Steps to Run:

    Clone the repository:

git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_name>

Create the source and backup directories:

mkdir -p ~/project/src
echo "Test file content" > ~/project/src/test.txt

Make the script executable:

chmod +x script.sh

Run the script:

./script.sh

Verify the log file:

    cat ~/backup.log

Example Usage:

    Running the Script:
    The script will automatically create a backup of the files:

./backup.sh

Result: Files from ~/project/src will be copied to ~/project/backup.

Backup Log:
The backup.log file will store entries for each operation, such as:

    Backup completed: Fri Jan 12 10:23:45 UTC 2025

Commands Used:

    mkdir: Create directories.
    cp: Copy files.
    echo: Write messages to the log file.

Possible Enhancements:

    Add size validation for the backup directory before copying files.
    Implement email notifications upon backup completion.
    Allow command-line arguments for customizable SRC and BACKUP paths.
